# Flywheel Inverted Pendulum Simulation

This project implements a **flywheel-based inverted pendulum** simulation and control system. The goal is to maintain the pendulum in the upright position by applying torque through a high-speed flywheel, demonstrating principles of **dynamic stabilization, control, and feedback**.
